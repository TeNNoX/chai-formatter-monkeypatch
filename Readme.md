# chai-formatter-monkeypatch

There is an issue about this: https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/1352  
And a monkey-patch solution - from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28652362/1633985) which i packaged into this.

I am a bit ashamed myself of not creating a PR to fix it instead, which would've probably taken a similar amount of time. ðŸ˜³
